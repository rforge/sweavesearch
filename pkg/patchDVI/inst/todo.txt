Done: Fix the generation of the concordance to make more sense:  RLE of diffs of
vector of Rnw lines corresponding to each .tex line, for example.

Done: Fix bug:  code references are miscounted.

Done: Fix dvi patch routine to allow expansion of specials.

Remove empty specials?  NA=remove instead of ignore would work.
