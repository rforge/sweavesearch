Done: Fix the generation of the concordance to make more sense:  RLE of diffs of
vector of Rnw lines corresponding to each .tex line, for example.

Done: Fix bug:  code references are miscounted.

Done: Fix dvi patch routine to allow expansion of specials.

Done:  Remove empty specials.  NA=remove 

Add patchSynctex() function to patch a .synctex file.  We might want to use

\newcommand{\Sconcordance}[1]{\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined \csname newcount\endcsname\pdfoutput \fi%
\ifcase\pdfoutput\special{#1}\else\immediate\pdfobj{#1}\fi}

and have Sweave wrap the concordance in \Sconcordance, rather than in \special.
