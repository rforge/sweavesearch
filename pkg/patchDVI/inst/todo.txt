Do something with RMarkdown files.  For example:

 - provide a style for an inclusion (no header), that has a "root" property
 saying which file to process.
 - write something like SweaveAll that processes the inclusion and then does
 latex on the rest of the files.
 
Issues:  - There is no equivalent to reverse search from PDF to markdown or R markdown source.
 - pandoc will need fancy handling.
